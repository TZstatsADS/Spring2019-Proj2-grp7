### **Project summary**: 

In a digital era where information is easy to access and more transparent than ever, people can be overwhelmed from the superfulous options and finidng it hard to make an efficient and smart choice. This can be especially when it comes 

As a result, people are paying more attention to improve their quality of life as much as possible. Then, they realize how important keeping healthy is to maximize their happiness.

As a consequence, selecting the most appropriate one efficiently and effectively becomes really necessary and avoids unwanted troubles.

If you are thinking of finding hispitals you can go, you can just save your time and look at our app. Our group has created an app helping you to find the best hospitals around you based on your preferences on 7 aspects of hospitals including mortality, safety of care, readmission rate, patient experience, effectiveness of care, timeliness of care and efficient use of medical imaging. With your choice, it will be so easy to find the one fits you the best.

-- User Manual:

--- Welcome & About:

--- Key Statistics:

--- Hospital Recommendation: This is the page where users can use our app to search for spcific hospitals. The search criteria on the left enables users to narrow the search results down by location, cost, emergency services or distance. Additionally, if one enters a zipcode, the website locates the user by the zipcode and calculate the distance between all hospitals to the given zipcode. Once given all the search criteria, the website automatically ranks the results to decide which results come on top of the list, based on an algorithem that takes strength, weakness and cost into accounts.
