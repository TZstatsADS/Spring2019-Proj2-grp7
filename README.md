__Seungwook Han__
* Brainstormed and proposed ideas for improvement in the features of the app (changing the general UI for the welcome page, combining two data tables into one, and changing the filters for more appropriate ones that are relevant in searching for hospitals)
* Designed and coded the 'Welcome' page
* Designed the coded the 'Meet the Team' and 'Data' pages under 'About'
* Re-structured the layout of the datatable and map in the 'Hospital Recommendation' page
* Embedded hyperlinks into the hospital name column of the datatable so that it links to the US News hospital search with the respective name
